I am Wang Jiangyi, a master student at NUS Faculty of Science. I received my B.S. degree from Suzhou University in 2022. Currently, my majority is Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML), focusing on Deep Learning related topics. In my first year in NUS, I learnt Mathematics with a CAP of 5.0/5.0 and 8 A+ courses.

From January to September in 2023, I joined I2R department in A*STAR as one Research Intern, supervised by Dr. [Yang Xulei](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=tXkwIK8AAAAJ&hl=en). During this period, I mainly focused on 3D Computer Vision, including point clouds classification, segmentation and occupancy prediction tasks. By the end of this internship, I submitted 2 papers in RA-L journal and ICASSP conference.
