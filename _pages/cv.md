## Education
* B.S. in GitHub, Suzhou University, 2018
* M.Sc. in Mathematics, National University of Singapore, 2021
* M.Sc. in Data Science and Machine Learning, National University of Singapore, 2022

## Research Experience
* Spring 2023: Research Intern
  * A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research).
  * Responsibility:
    * Conduct comprehensive survey on: 3D point clouds <b>classification/detection/segmentation</b>, <b>semi-supervised learning</b> approaches and <b>incremental learning</b> approaches.  
    * Better <b>capture local structures</b> of point clouds data in network architecture design. Propose one novel plug-and-play module for PointNet++ backbone, which can explicitly capture local geometry.
    * <b>BEV-based methods</b> for <b>occupancy prediction</b> tasks, which are widely applied in autonomous driving. Propose one UNet-like occupancy head and class-balancing loss to significantly improve the model performance on nuScenes dataset.
  * Supervisor:
    * Dr. [Yang Xulei](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=tXkwIK8AAAAJ&hl=en).
